This is the 2nd of 5 projects that I will be completing. This project will focus on using Sinatra CRUD Apllicaton to create Control Management System based-app. Utilizing RESTful routes, this app will shoes lovers like myslef keep track of their ever growing shoe(sneaker) collection.
They can message on another to trade shoes or buy shoes.(This feature is coming soon.)
