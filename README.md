This is the 2nd of 5 projects that I will be completing. This project will focus on using Sinatra to create Control Management System based-app that(can) will me keep track of my ever growing shoe(sneaker) collection and other people as well. They can message on another to trade shoes or buy shoes.



What do I need to accomplish?:
I want to be able to keep track of my sneakers and other peoples sneakers.

What must my app have/do?
>Users
>A way  for U to signup,login,logout
>Validate that each U is themselves(via email or username)
>A way for each U to keep track of only their shoes.
> each U should be able to Create, Read, Update, and/or Destroy their collection of shoes.
>make sure U do not have the ability to edit and/or delete other peoples stuff.
